  <p>This grass roots organization that utilizes innovative  approaches to helping veterans of all wars with the entire spectrum of the  effects of war and military service. The organization is made up of veterans,  mental health professionals, and citizens. Not  only are the group members involved with helping veterans but their families and  the community as well. This small grass roots organization is one that fosters  alternative as well as mainstream approaches to helping veterans with the  diagnosis of PTSD. Not only are the group members involved with helping  veterans but their families as well. Since I am one of the founding members, I  have a strong preference for the work. <a href="http://www.Veteransheartgeorgia.org">www.Veteransheartgeorgia.org</a></p><img class="img_section" src="../images/military.jpg">
  <p>Veteran’s Heart Georgia fosters the healing of  veterans of all wars by attending to the spiritual and emotional needs of  veterans, their families, and our communities.</p>
  <p>We are addressing the  effects of war by creating a <strong>community-based  network of services, resources and education.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>This network  includes:</strong></p>
    <ol start="1" type="1">
      <li>consultation with specially trained counselors and       mental health clinicians for veterans and families;</li>
      <li>workshops and programs for veterans, couples       and families, community gatherings and training for professionals;</li>
      <li>outreach and mentoring by trained, seasoned       veterans;</li>
      <li>community education and involvement.</li>
    </ol>
  <p>This work was influenced  by concepts found in the book, <u>War and the Soul</u>, by Edward Tick.</p><p>
    <strong>We believe that:</strong> </p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>There is healing for the invisible wounds of war-related       PTSD*</li>
      <li>The core work is the nurturing of a positive       warrior identity</li>
      <li>The suffering of families must be addressed,       including the unaddressed wounds of war passed down through generations of       families that have experienced war.</li>
      <li>The citizens of our communities, those who are       protected and guarded, must share the burden of the wounds of those who       have gone to war.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>“Veterans are the light at the tip of the  candle, illuminating the way for the whole nation. If veterans can achieve awareness, transformation, understanding, and peace, they can share with the rest of society the realities of war. And they can teach us how to make peace with ourselves and each other, so we never have to use violence to resolve conflicts again”.</em></p>
      <p>- Thich Nhat Hahn</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>We invite all to  begin the journey toward healing and resolution, recovery and reconciliation,  moving towards a mature, peaceful and balanced Warrior identity for our  veterans.</strong></p>
    <p><em>Veteran’s  Heart Georgia  has no political agenda, no goals beyond fostering healing from the effects of  war. Our work is focused right here, on this healing.</em></p>

  <p><em><a href="http://www.dav.org/veterans/MilitaryAffairs.aspx">The Disabled American Veterans Organization</a> is one of the oldest  organizations helping Veterans. One of the criteria for working at DAV is that the service officers have a disability that was inflicted on the officer while  he or she was in the military on active duty.</em></p>
  <p>Disabled  American Veterans has never wavered in our commitment to serve our nation’s  service-connected disabled veterans, their dependents and survivors. Our  largest endeavor in fulfilling that mission is our National Service Program. In  88 offices throughout the United States and in Puerto Rico, the DAV employs a  corps of approximately 260 National Service Officers (NSOs) who represent  veterans and their families with claims for benefits from the Department of  Veterans Affairs (VA), the Department of Defense and other government agencies.  Veterans need not be DAV members to take advantage of this outstanding  assistance, which is provided free of charge. </p>
  <p>NSOs function as attorneys-in-fact, assisting veterans and their families in  filing claims for VA disability compensation and pension; vocational  rehabilitation and employment; education; home loan guaranty; life insurance;  death benefits; health care and much more. They provide free services, such as  information seminars, counseling and community outreach. NSOs also represent  veterans and active duty military personnel before Discharge Review Boards,  Boards for Correction of Military Records, Physical Evaluation Boards and other  official panels. </p>

  <p align="center"><strong>Who We Are</strong></p>
  <p align="center"><em>This group has been very helpful in so many  different ways that I will let it speak for itself.</em></p>
  <p><a href="http://www.soldiersangels.org/">Soldiers'  Angels</a> was started by a self-described ordinary mother of two American soldiers,  Patti Patton-Bader.  Her eldest son, Staff Sergeant Brandon, deployed to  Iraq from 2003-2004, and her youngest was deployed in 2008.</p>
  <p>In  the summer of his 2003 deployment, Brandon expressed concern that some soldiers  in his unit did not receive any mail or support from home. Being a loving and  caring mother, Patti decided not to allow a situation like that to continue.  She quickly contacted a handful of friends and extended family and asked if  they would support a soldier or two. Within just a few months, Soldiers' Angels  went from a mother sending a few extra care packages and letters, to an  Internet community with thousands of Angels worldwide.  With more and more  merchants donating services, money and items for packages, Soldiers' Angels  reorganized as a 501(c)(3) non-profit in 2004.</p>
  <p>Soldiers'  Angels currently supports tens of thousands of American military personnel  stationed wherever we raise our nation's flag. In December 2004, an <a href="http://soldiersangelsforum.com/">online forum</a> was created to provide  coordination for the thousands of Angels helping to meet the needs of our  heroes. As of April 2008, our membership numbers more than 200,000  volunteers, led by an all-volunteer Board of Trustees and Officers. Today, Soldiers' Angels works around the world to address military-related  needs ranging from deployed support to wounded care to remembrance of the  fallen, and a wide variety of assistance for military families.</p>
  <p>As  a volunteer-based nonprofit, we have over 30 different teams supporting all  branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. Through special projects, dedicated teams,  and individuals supporting our troops, we make a visible difference in the  lives of our service members and their families.

  <h3><strong><a name="IWOW" id="IWOW"></a>Invisible Wounds of  War: Psychological and Cognitive Injuries, Their Consequences, and Services to  Assist Recovery</strong></h3>
  <p>In  2008, The Rand cooperation published Invisible  Wounds of War: Psychological and Cognitive Injuries, Their Consequences, and  Services to Assist Recovery. This comprehensive work is certainly the most  complete work of its kind concerning PTSD, War, and soldiers and their  situations on return from combat in Iraq  and Afghanistan.  Since it publication, I believe it has become the most quoted work of its kind. The Rand group won the following award in 2008 for this body  of work: WINNER — 2008 PROSE Award — Clinical Medicine. The American Publishers  Award for Professional and Scholarly Excellence</p>
  <p>This report is an objective  investigation into the many costs (i.e., emotional, financial, physical, etc)  of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  It estimates that PTSD and depression among returning service members  will cost the nation as much as $6.2 billion in the two years following  deployment.</p>
  <p>The full text of the report  can be found by clicking on the following link: <a href="MilitaryIWW/RAND_IWW.pdf">Invisible  Wounds of War</a>. Adobe Acrobat Reader required to  view the file</p>
  <p>Due to the size of the  report, it has been broken up into the following sections for ease of reading.

  <p>I really  like what these folks are doing and the fact that so many have used this  service indicates to me that good is being done. I have been a volunteer on the  web page for over a year and have not been contacted by the service or vets  using the service. I still list them because I believe in the cause and it  makes sense to have this service.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Our  Mission</strong></p>
  <p>Our mission is to  develop national networks of volunteers capable of responding to both  acute and chronic conditions that arise within our society. Our first target  population is the U.S.  troops and families who are being affected by the current military conflicts in  Afghanistan and Iraq.  Give an Hour™ is asking mental health professionals nationwide to donate an  hour of their time each week to provide free mental health services to military  personnel and their families. Research will guide the development of additional  services needed by the military community, and appropriate networks will be  created to respond to those needs. Individuals who receive services will be  given the opportunity to give an hour back in their own community. We are also  offering services to parents, siblings, and unmarried partners who are not  entitled to receive mental health benefits through the military</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Our Focus</strong></p>
  <p>Our organization is currently focusing on the psychological needs of military  personnel and their families because of the significant human cost of the  current conflicts. Over 1.8 million troops have been deployed in Afghanistan, Iraq,  and the Persian Gulf since September 11, 2001.  Nearly 550,000 of these troops have been deployed more than once. According to  the U.S. Department of Defense, as of March 24, 2009, a total of 4,926  American troops have died in Iraq  and Afghanistan.  In addition, 33,856 U.S.  troops have been injured during these conflicts.</p>
    <p>In addition to the physical injuries sustained,  countless servicemen and servicewomen have experienced psychological symptoms  directly related to their deployment. According to a RAND report released in  April 2008, over 18 percent of troops who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan--nearly 300,000  troops--have symptoms of post-traumatic stress or major depression.</p>
    <p>A major barrier preventing military personnel from  seeking appropriate treatment is the perception of stigma associated with  treatment. Many fear that seeking mental health services will jeopardize their  career or standing. Others are reluctant to expose their vulnerabilities to  providers who are often military personnel themselves, given the military  culture’s emphasis on strength, confidence, and bravery. Servicemen and  servicewomen might be more inclined to seek help if they know that the services  provided are completely independent of the military. By providing services that  are separate from the military establishment, we offer an essential option for  men and women who might otherwise fail to seek or receive appropriate services.</p>
    <p align="center"><strong><a href="http://www.careforthetroops.com">Care For The Troops</a></strong></p>
    <p align="center">Care For The Troops, Inc. is a 501 c3 Non-Profit formed to develop a network  of civilian faith communities, civic organizations, and networks of therapists  all trained and able to work with the military members, veterans, and their  families as they adjust to the changes experienced during and after returning  from deployments and combat.</p>
    <p><strong>Our Mission…:</strong></p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Work       to improve the ability of the civilian mental health infrastructure in the       State of Georgia,       then nationally, to work with military family members </li>
      <li>Facilitate connecting military families to providers of spiritual and psychological       services familiar with the military culture and trauma </li>
      <li>Focus       on addressing combat stress recovery as well as other spiritual and mental       health related problems impacting the marriages and families of military       veterans  </li>
      <li>Educate       and train clinicians, congregation and community leaders, extended family,       and civilian groups about the military culture and trauma associated with       military deployments in order to better assess and treat mental health       symptoms, and provide more effective referrals and care </li>
      <li>Provide       opportunities for additional trauma treatment training to clinicians </li>
      <li>Operate       in an interfaith, non-political manner, focusing on the humanitarian       interest that benefits the veterans and their extended family members </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>WHO  is the site for? ...</strong> This site is for military members, their immediate and extended family members;  whether there is a family member deployed, between deployments, recently  returned, or separated. It is also for mental health professionals,  congregation and community leaders, and others who are in positions to provide  help, compassion, or advice to those who are recovering from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. </p>
    <p><strong>WHY  visit this site? ...</strong> This site will help those who are both near and far from the existing DOD and  VA facilities; who may be having difficulty getting the help needed in a timely  manner. We are working to help better educate and train an additional civilian  cadre of mental health professionals and community and congregation leaders on  how better to understand the issues of those affected by the Iraq and Afghanistan conflict. The goal is  to be able to provide the needed resources that can address the mental health  issues when they arise and cause any further delay in receiving treatment.</p>
    <p>Congregation leaders would include  leaders of all faiths. Community Leader examples are school counselors, family  practice doctors, members of social service organizations, police chiefs, fire  chiefs, or other employers. It is without limits as it includes all civilians  who come in contact with our brave veterans and their family members.</p>
    <p><strong>Our  Goal for this web site? ...</strong> We want this website to be a resource you can rely upon and trust to help  better understand the mental health issues of US military and their extended  families resulting from the current conflicts in Iraq  and Afghanistan.  By better understanding the issues, more will recognize the symptoms and  triggers and this will result in a better quality and quantity of referrals to  mental health professionals.</p>

  <h3><strong>Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America</strong></h3>
  <p align="center">“This group is one of the best, well organized  and helpful organizations I have encountered. It was started by and maintained  by Veterans that served in Iraq  and or Afghanistan,  certainly one of a kind. “</p>
  <p><strong>Our Mission:</strong> IAVA’s mission is to improve the lives of Iraq  and Afghanistan  veterans and their families.</p>
  <p><strong>The Need:</strong> The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are in their sixth and  seventh years respectively. More than 1.7 million American troops have served  in Iraq or Afghanistan, and thousands have  been deployed multiple times.</p>
  <p>IAVA addresses critical  issues facing new veterans and their families, including mental health,  Traumatic Brain Injury, a stretched VA system, inadequate health coverage for  national guardsmen and reservists, and outdated GI Bill educational benefits.</p>
  <p>IAVA is dedicated to  educating the public about the wars in Iraq  and Afghanistan,  advocating on behalf of those who have served, and fostering a community for  troops, veterans, and their families.</p>
  <p><strong>History:</strong> IAVA was founded in 2004 by current  Executive Director Paul Rieckhoff and his fellow Iraq  and Afghanistan  veterans. After returning home from their tours, these veterans came together  after quickly becoming concerned with the way the war in Iraq was being portrayed in the  media and the overall plight of newly returned veterans. There were many policy  experts, and talking heads on TV, but very few people who had actually served  on the ground in Iraq or Afghanistan. There was no one talking about what our  wounded friends needed, and the issues they faced. The creation of IAVA allowed  thousands of veterans to join the national dialogue, and to explain what was  really happening on the ground overseas and back home in the US.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>IAVA Membership</strong></p>
  <p>Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America  (IAVA) is the country’s first and largest non-profit organization that works to  improve the lives of OIF/OEF veterans and their families. We have over 125,000  veteran members and supporters are growing rapidly. IAVA members comprise the  largest community of veterans of the wars in Iraq  and Afghanistan  in the country.</p>

  <p><strong>The Veterans Administration</strong> is the U.S. Government’s department that is  the direct care giver for our veterans that have served honorably during peace  time as well as in time of war. Listed here is what they say about themselves.  This department has been under fire for many reported abuses since its  inception. It is our government, our department for helping veterans, and it is  up to Americans to help this government agency perform at its best.</p>
  <p>Their stated  goal is to provide excellence in patient care, veterans' benefits and customer  satisfaction. We have reformed our department internally and are striving for  high quality, prompt and seamless service to veterans. Our department's  employees continue to offer their dedication and commitment to help veterans  get the services they have earned. Our nation's veterans deserve no less.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Our Nation's Veterans</strong></p>
  <p>Of  the 25 million veterans currently alive, nearly three of every four served  during a war or an official period of hostility. About a quarter of the  nation's population -- approximately 70 million people -- are potentially eligible  for VA benefits and services because they are veterans, family members or  survivors of veterans.</p>
